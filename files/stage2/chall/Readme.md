Hey Trou, 

Do you remember the discussion we had last year at the secret SSTIC party? We planned to create the next SSTIC challenge to prove that we are still skilled enough to be trusted by the community.  

I attached the alpha version of my amazing challenge based on maze solving.

You can play with it in order to hunt some remaining bugs. It's hosted on my workstation at home, you can reach it at challenge2021.sstic.org:4577.

I've written in the env.txt file all the information about the remote configuration if needed.

Have Fun,
